# Project Base for the Yapily Marvel code test

This project can be used as a starting point to create your own Vaadin Flow application with Spring Boot.
It contains all the necessary configuration and some placeholder files to get you started.

This was extended for the Marvel test after being generated via [vaadin.com/start](https://vaadin.com/start).

Import the project to the IDE of your choosing as a Maven project. 

Run application using `mvn spring-boot:run` or directly running Application class from your IDE.
